# Docker Registry

The JFrog Artifactory product includes a fully featured Docker Registry, supporting both v1 and v2 APIs, with built in security and also the ability to proxy to remote images.

For more details on how to use the Docker Registry [see here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Repositories)

Two URLs are registered to access to the Docker Registry:

1. https://artifactory-docker-dev.system-domain.my-pcf.com
1. https://aritfactory-docker-prod.system-domain.my-pcf.com

At the moment these route names are not configurable.
